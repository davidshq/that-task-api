# That Task API

## Introduction

There are a bazillion task / project management apps out there and I've used a wide variety of them and none does what I want the way I want.

I don't want to add to the mess so I'm focusing on an API/backend first. The goal is to make something that others can use as a solid foundation for their own task / project management apps.

## Stuff Goes Here

You know, I'll say more someday.
