# What About a UI?

## Introduction

The idea with The Task API is to create a solid foundation on which folks can build UIs for task applications that work for them - rather than needing to start from the ground up every single time.

I eventually intend to build a UI, but it may not work for you. It will certainly be tweaked for me. Still, it is useful to consider some of the sort of UI functionality one might want to have and to consider this as building out the API.
