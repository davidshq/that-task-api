# Unique Functionality

## Introduction

Someone probably else has done these, in fact I know a number of them have been implemented, but I'm highlighting them here because these are the features I think The Task API should support that aren't commonly supported.

- Gamification
- Non-Member Notifications
- Non-Member Interactions

## Non-Members
Sometimes tasks depend on people who we can't or who won't utilize our system. How do we meld them into our system? One way is by allowing individuals to create non-member users. They'd need to verify acceptance but the basic idea is that they could receive notifications that they could interact with using their normal communication systems without needing to actually be members of the system.
