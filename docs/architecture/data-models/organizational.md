# Is Everything A List?

I'm thinking *almost everything* could be a list?

In many apps one has all these different organizational types - e.g. "Company", "Department", "Project", "Group", "List" and these often are nested deeply:

Company -> Department -> Project -> Group -> List

And each of these has different attributes. In this case you could still nest deepily but it would look like this:

Company (Type: List) -> Department (Type: List) -> Project (Type: List) -> Group (Type: List) -> Task (Type: Task)
